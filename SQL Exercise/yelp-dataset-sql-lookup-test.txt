Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.

Select count(*) as Total_Business
From Business

iii. Category table =
Code:
Select count(*) as Total_Category
From Category

iv. Checkin table = 10000
Code:
Select count(*) as Total_Checkin
From Checkin

SELECT count(distinct business_id) as total FROM  Attribute

v. Review = 1000 (id), 8090 (business_id),  9581 (user_id)
Code:
SELECT count(distinct id) as total_1, count(distinct business_id) as total_2, count(distinct user_id) as total_3 FROM review

vi. Checkin =  493 (business_id)
Code:
SELECT count(distinct business_id) as total From Checkin

vii. Photo = 10000(id),6493(business_id)
Code:
SELECT count(distinct id) as total_1, count(distinct business_id) as total_2 From Photo

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
I picked Toronto and Food for this question. Yes. The
restaurants with only 2.5 stars open from 8:00-22:00 on
Saturday. The places with higher rating stars open late on Saturday. 

i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
Yes. The group with 2-3 stars has less review (10) compared with
the group with higher rating stars.

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
 No really. They have different locations.        
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

SQL code used for analysis:
SELECT
business.name
, business.city
, category.category
, business.stars
,hours.hours,
business.review_count,
business.address,
business.postal_code
FROM (business INNER JOIN category ON business.id = 
category.business_id) INNER JOIN hours ON hours.business_id =
business.id
WHERE business.city = 'Toronto' AND category.category = "Food"
GROUP BY business.stars;

Result:
+--------------+---------+----------+-------+----------------------+--------------+----------------------+-------------+
| name         | city    | category | stars | hours                | review_count | address              | postal_code |
+--------------+---------+----------+-------+----------------------+--------------+----------------------+-------------+
| Loblaws      | Toronto | Food     |   2.5 | Saturday|8:00-22:00  |           10 | 2280 Dundas Street W | M6R 1X3     |
| Halo Brewery | Toronto | Food     |   4.0 | Saturday|11:00-21:00 |           15 | 247 Wallace Avenue   | M6H 1V5     |
| Cabin Fever  | Toronto | Food     |   4.5 | Saturday|16:00-2:00  |           26 | 1669 Bloor Street W  | M6P 1A6     |
+--------------+---------+----------+-------+----------------------+--------------+----------------------+-------------+

		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
The ones that are still open have more reviews on
average than ones that are closed        
         
ii. Difference 2:
There are more business that are still open listed as
“useful” or “funny”.
       
         
         
SQL code used for analysis:
SELECT
AVG(b.stars),SUM(b.review_count),AVG(b.review_count),COUNT(r.useful)+COUNT(r.funny),is_open
FROM business b INNER JOIN review r ON b.id = r.id
GROUP BY b.is_open

Result:
+---------------+---------------------+---------------------+--------------------------------+---------+
|  AVG(b.stars) | SUM(b.review_count) | AVG(b.review_count) | COUNT(r.useful)+COUNT(r.funny) | is_open |
+---------------+---------------------+---------------------+--------------------------------+---------+
|           2.0 |                   4 |                 4.0 |                              2 |       0 |
| 2.96153846154 |                 504 |       38.7692307692 |                             26 |       1 |
+---------------+---------------------+---------------------+--------------------------------+---------+
	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
Here I chose to study the preference among different types of food on yelp. 
         
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
I will pick several types of food including
“Chinese”,”Mexican”,”Korean”,”French”,”Italian”,”Japanese” and
“Indian”. Then I will analyze their star ratings and number of
reviews so that I can get some insights on which type of food is
popular on yelp.                           
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
 +----------+----------------------+---------------+-------------------+-----------+
| category | Number_Of_Resturants |    AVG(stars) | AVG(review_count) | city      |
+----------+----------------------+---------------+-------------------+-----------+
| Korean   |                    7 |           4.5 |               8.0 | Toronto   |
| French   |                   12 |           4.0 |     135.083333333 | Las Vegas |
| Chinese  |                   13 | 3.76923076923 |     423.230769231 | Las Vegas |
| Mexican  |                   28 |         3.625 |              73.0 | Edinburgh |
| Italian  |                   13 | 3.53846153846 |     78.2307692308 | Montréal  |
| Japanese |                   20 |         3.475 |             22.85 | Toronto   |
+----------+----------------------+---------------+-------------------+-----------+        
         
iv. Provide the SQL code you used to create your final dataset:

SELECT c.category,COUNT(b.name) AS
Number_Of_Resturants,AVG(stars),AVG(review_count),b.city
FROM (business b INNER JOIN hours h ON b.id = h.business_id)
INNER JOIN category c ON c.business_id = b.id
WHERE c.category IN
("Chinese","Mexican","French","Italian","Korean","Japanese","Ind
ian")
GROUP BY c.category
ORDER BY AVG(stars) DESC
